## Gameplay

To start a round... both players flip over the top card of their deck at the same time.... This card is placed face up on the playing surface.
The player with the higher-ranking card wins the round and collects both cards. The cards are placed face down at the bottom of the player's deck.
If the cards flipped by both players have the same rank, a war occurs. Each player puts three cards face down and flips over a fourth card. The higher-ranking fourth card wins all the cards in that battle, as well as the cards from the previous battles.
If another tie occurs during a war, the process repeats until one player wins the round.
The game continues until one player has won all the cards in the deck, making them the winner.
