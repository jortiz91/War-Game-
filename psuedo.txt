<!-- Shuffle the deck of cards





Divide the deck evenly between two players (26 cards each)





While both players have cards left in their decks




  Both players turn over the top card of their deck at the same time




  Whoever has the higher card wins both cards and puts them at the bottom of their deck


  If both cards are the same rank






    Declare war--Game time! lol






    Both players place three cards face down and flip the fourth card



    The player with the higher card wins all the cards on the table and puts them at the bottom of their deck



    If there is another tie.. go back to the beginning of this step until there is a winner




The game is over when one player has all the cards, making them the winner -->
